# Typing Indicators Implementation

## Overview
Added real-time typing indicators to the chat system that show when users are typing messages.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend Changes

1. **New Types** (`drawsy-frontend/src/types/game.ts`)
   - Added `TypingUser` interface
   - Added typing events to `SocketEvents` interface

2. **Game Store Updates** (`drawsy-frontend/src/store/gameStore.ts`)
   - Added `typingUsers` state array
   - Added typing user management actions:
     - `addTypingUser()`
     - `removeTypingUser()`
     - `clearTypingUsers()`
   - Added `useTypingUsers()` selector

3. **Socket Service Updates** (`drawsy-frontend/src/services/socket.ts`)
   - Added `sendTypingStart()` method
   - Added `sendTypingStop()` method
   - Added `onTypingStart()` event listener
   - Added `onTypingStop()` event listener

4. **New TypingIndicator Component** (`drawsy-frontend/src/components/TypingIndicator.tsx`)
   - Shows animated dots when users are typing
   - Positioned above the input box for better UX
   - Compact design with subtle background and border
   - Displays user names in different formats:
     - Single user: "Mahesh is typing..."
     - Two users: "Mahesh and Suresh are typing..."
     - Multiple users: "Mahesh, Suresh and John are typing..."
   - Filters out current user from display
   - Uses player names from game state when available

5. **ChatPanel Updates** (`drawsy-frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`)
   - Added typing detection logic
   - Sends typing start/stop events based on input activity
   - Auto-stops typing after 2 seconds of inactivity
   - Stops typing when message is sent
   - Includes TypingIndicator component above input box (better UX)
   - Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Backend Changes

1. **Game Gateway Updates** (`drawsy-backend/src/gateways/game.gateway.ts`)
   - Added `@SubscribeMessage('typing_start')` handler
   - Added `@SubscribeMessage('typing_stop')` handler
   - Broadcasts typing events to all other players in the room
   - Automatically sends typing_stop when player disconnects

## How It Works

### Typing Detection Flow
1. User starts typing in chat input
2. Frontend detects input change and sends `typing_start` event
3. Backend broadcasts to all other players in the room
4. Other players see typing indicator with animated dots
5. After 2 seconds of inactivity OR when message is sent, `typing_stop` is sent
6. Typing indicator disappears for that user

### User Experience
- **Single user typing**: "Mahesh is typing..."
- **Multiple users typing**: "Mahesh, Suresh and John are typing..."
- **Animated dots**: Three dots that scale up and down in sequence
- **Real-time updates**: Indicators appear/disappear instantly
- **Optimal positioning**: Shows above input box, not in middle of empty chat
- **Clean UI**: Compact design with subtle background that doesn't interfere with chat

### Technical Details
- Uses debounced typing detection (2-second timeout)
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Filters current user from typing indicators
- Uses player names from game state for accuracy
- Handles edge cases like disconnections and component unmounts

## Testing
- Frontend and backend both compile successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Typing indicators work independently of other chat features

## Future Enhancements
- Could add typing indicator persistence across reconnections
- Could add different typing states (e.g., "thinking", "responding")
- Could add typing indicator in other areas of the app
