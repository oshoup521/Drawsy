# Duplicate Guess Reward Fix

## Problem
Players were able to guess the correct word multiple times and receive rewards each time, which was unfair to other players.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **Added `correctGuessers` field to Game entity** (`drawsy-backend/src/entities/game.entity.ts`)
   - Added `correctGuessers: string[]` to track players who have already guessed correctly in the current round

2. **Updated `checkGuess` method** (`drawsy-backend/src/services/game.service.ts`)
   - Added check to prevent duplicate rewards for players who have already guessed correctly
   - Returns a special response with `alreadyGuessedCorrectly: true` for duplicate correct guesses
   - Adds player to `correctGuessers` list when they guess correctly for the first time

3. **Reset correct guessers on new rounds**
   - `selectWordAndStartRound` method now resets `correctGuessers` to empty array
   - `startNextRound` method also resets `correctGuessers` to empty array

4. **Database migration** (`drawsy-backend/src/database/migrations/1735318800000-AddCorrectGuessersToGame.ts`)
   - Added migration to add `correctGuessers` column to games table

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated GameState interface** (`drawsy-frontend/src/types/game.ts`)
   - Added `correctGuessers?: string[]` field
   - Added `alreadyGuessedCorrectly?: boolean` to GuessResult interface

2. **Enhanced GuessPanel component** (`drawsy-frontend/src/components/GuessPanel.tsx`)
   - Added check for `hasAlreadyGuessedCorrectly` based on current user and game state
   - Shows success message instead of input when player has already guessed correctly
   - Prevents further guessing attempts from players who have already guessed correctly

3. **Updated GameRoom component** (`drawsy-frontend/src/pages/GameRoom.tsx`)
   - Enhanced `handleGuessResult` to handle `alreadyGuessedCorrectly` responses
   - Updates game state with correct guessers list when players guess correctly
   - Resets correct guessers list when new rounds start

## How It Works

1. **First Correct Guess**: Player guesses correctly → gets points → added to `correctGuessers` list → guess input disabled
2. **Duplicate Guess Attempt**: Player tries to guess again → backend detects they're already in `correctGuessers` → returns friendly message → no points awarded
3. **New Round**: `correctGuessers` list is reset → all players can guess again

## Benefits

- ✅ Prevents duplicate rewards for the same player
- ✅ Maintains fair gameplay
- ✅ Provides clear feedback to players who have already guessed correctly
- ✅ Automatically resets for each new round
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing games

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Start a game with multiple players
2. Have one player guess the correct word
3. Verify they receive points and their guess input is disabled
4. Try to have the same player guess again (should show message, no points)
5. Start a new round and verify the player can guess again

The fix ensures fair gameplay by preventing players from gaming the system with multiple correct guesses.
