# Test Guess Functionality

## What was implemented:

### Frontend (React/TypeScript):
1. **Updated GameRoom.tsx**: Added `handleGuessResult` function to handle both correct and incorrect guesses
2. **Updated ChatPanel.tsx**: Added styling and display logic for correct/incorrect guess messages
3. **Updated types/game.ts**: Extended ChatMessage and GuessResult interfaces with new fields
4. **Updated App.css**: Added green/red background animations for correct/incorrect guesses

### Backend (NestJS/TypeScript):
- Already properly implemented in game.gateway.ts and game.service.ts
- Broadcasts `guess_result` events with all necessary data including `funnyResponse`

### LLM Service (Python/FastAPI):
- Already implemented with both OpenRouter AI and fallback funny responses
- `/generate-funny-response` endpoint working with context-aware humor

## How it works:
1. Player makes a guess in GuessPanel
2. Backend checks guess and generates funny response for wrong guesses
3. Frontend receives `guess_result` event
4. Chat shows:
   - **Green background + glow animation** for correct guesses (without showing the word to avoid spoiling)
   - **Red background + shake animation** for incorrect guesses with the wrong guess shown + funny AI response

## Fixed Issues:
- ✅ Removed duplicate correct guess messages
- ✅ Don't show the correct word when someone guesses right (to avoid spoiling for other players)
- ✅ Only show the actual guess text for incorrect guesses

## Test Steps:
1. Start all services (FE, BE, LLM)
2. Create a game room with 2+ players
3. Start game and have drawer select a word
4. Non-drawer makes incorrect guess → should see red message with funny response
5. Non-drawer makes correct guess → should see green celebration message
